  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 15, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Service govern your use of the privately-hosted FBN Upload, including automated workflows that interface with Google APIs via OAuth authentication.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The service is intended solely for personal, non-commercial use.</li>
    <li>Use of Google OAuth is limited to authenticating with and publishing to your own Google account (e.g., uploading videos to YouTube).</li>
    <li>You may not use this tool to perform actions on behalf of others without proper authorization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. No Warranty</h2>
  <p>The service is provided "as is" with no guarantees of uptime, accuracy, or availability. You use the system at your own risk. The administrator is not responsible for any loss of data, account issues, or API limitations resulting from use.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Handling</h2>
  <p>No personal information is stored or shared. OAuth access tokens are used only in memory or within a secure private environment for authenticated actions. See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

  <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to use the service to:
    <ul>
      <li>Violate Googleâ€™s API terms of use</li>
      <li>Upload illegal or harmful content</li>
      <li>Attempt unauthorized access to accounts or data</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>6. Termination</h2>
  <p>The administrator may disable access at any time for security, maintenance, or misuse. Since the service is private, access is limited to approved users only.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes</h2>
  <p>These terms may be updated without notice. Continued use of the service implies acceptance of the latest version.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns, contact the administrator at <a href="mailto:ktsmith.kcp@gmail.com">ktsmith.kcp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <p><em>This is a self-hosted, non-commercial tool used solely for automation purposes by the owner.</em></p>
